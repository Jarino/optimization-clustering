# Optimization clustering

An example of clustering using optimization, namely minimization of trace of within-group dispersion matrix, AKA minimization of variance, AKA k-Means.

Uses [DEAP](https://github.com/DEAP/deap) library for implementation of genetic algorithm for optimization.

Based on knowledge aquired from book [Cluster Analysis](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Cluster+Analysis%2C+5th+Edition-p-9780470749913).
